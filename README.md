# thejosef.life - personal portfolio
Website project created for personal portfolio. Version release will mark the milestone for ART 4567 final project.


### Styling
Layout and design created solely using Flexbox, will be moving to utilize CSSGrid for further structure.

All styling is written in SASS, then compiled down using Grunt and the Ruby-based compiler. Grunt automates compiling, minifying, and distribution copying upon change.


### Task Runner and Modules
I have chosen to use Grunt to automate tasks. For this project I used npm installed the following packages:
* grunt
* grunt-load-tasks
* grunt-contrib-uglify
* grunt-contrib-watch
* grunt-sass
* grunt-contrib-cssmin
* grunt-contrib-copy
* grunt-git
