### Styling
All styling will be done in SASS, then compiled down using Grunt.


### Grunt Modules
I have chosen to use Grunt for the first time to automate tasks. For this project I installed the following npm packages:
	* grunt
	* grunt-load-tasks
	* grunt-contrib-uglify
	* grunt-contrib-watch
	* grunt-sass
	* grunt-git
