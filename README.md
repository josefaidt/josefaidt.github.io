Website project created for personal portfolio. Version release will mark the milestone for ART 4567 final project.




### Styling
All styling will be done in SASS, then compiled down using Grunt.


### Grunt Modules
I have chosen to use Grunt to automate tasks. For this project I installed the following npm packages:
	* grunt
	* grunt-load-tasks
	* grunt-contrib-uglify
	* grunt-contrib-watch
	* grunt-sass
	* grunt-git
