<strong>Course Reflection: </strong> Coming into this class with previous programming knowledge in Python, C++, Javascript, and  HTML/CSS, I was excited to dive into the world of windows form applications. Quickly, the skills I had learned were put to the test as I scoured to understand the syntax of the language. During class time the instructor provided us with practical applications thus solidifying the key points and concepts of the text. This class has ultimately driven me to seek more opportunities with programming as it is becoming a valuable asset in today's technological market.
