<!-- About you section -->
<strong>Welcome</strong> <br /> This portfolio provides comprehensive documentation of my work and experience in the Department of Information Systems and Decision Sciences at Louisiana State University.  The portfolio serves as a profile of my personal background and experiences as an undergraduate student.  <br /> Additionally, for each course in the program, I provide samples of work which demonstrate my proficiency and understanding of the material covered.  <br /> Beyond the required coursework, I provide documentation that showcases my involvement in extracurricular activities and my hobbies, as well as my resume.  <br />  <br /> <strong>A little about the author</strong> <br /> Josef is a 23-year-old ISDS senior at Louisiana State University. He is an aspiring web designer & developer with a passion for the great outdoors. When he isn't thinking about school he might be playing with his two goofball dogs, Marvin and Maverick. He might be hanging out with his friends enjoying their favorite music tracks, or he might just be listening to deep house music playing video games. The author is a sucker for movies with great soundtracks (i.e. written by John Williams) and Reese's seasonals. Over the years he's taken interest in the wild world of the web and all it has to offer. <a href="http://www.thejosef.life/about">Read more.</a>
