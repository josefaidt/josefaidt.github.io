<strong>Course Reflection: </strong>Big Data has never looked better. This course has taught me the importance of having clear, concise methods to view large amounts of data. By utilizing data manipulation languages such as SQL, XML, and R, I have been able to understand data manipulation and its role in the business world. Data manipulation methods reveal many patterns describing possibilities of advanced understandings like consumer decision-making, or as simple reporting a plethora of devices given a minute set of attributes. This course has forever changed my outlook on data mining and its importance with growing artificial-intelligent technologies.
