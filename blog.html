			    	<p>Let me just say this, <span class="bold">the Google Pixel is the best Android experience I've ever had.</span></p>
			    	<p class="indent">I grew up right as smartphones were becoming one of the must-haves during adolescence when the mobile market was dominated by the Motorola Razer and T9 texting. Claims aside my first phone was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(mobile_phone)" target="_blank">Firefly</a>, which was an indestructible phone meant for children ages 5-12; no WiFi capabilities, no Internet, just a phone limited to 48 contacts which were a pain to program because it only had four light-up buttons. I moved on to my father's old Blackberry until I got my first smartphone, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_Bold" target="_blank">Blackberry Bold</a>. This phone was released in 2009 during the beginning, and subsequently the end of REM's Blackberry App World. The iPhone was around and I was interested, however here came Android and the personalization capabilities intrigued me. Google's Android was a whole new world to me, as I acquired a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S II</a>, then a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_III" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S III</a>. Not in favor of the battery life that Samsung's products offered I bought the newly-Google-acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_X_(1st_generation)" target="_blank">Motorola Moto X (2013)</a> and then a Lenovo-owned Motorola <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_X_Style" target="_blank">Moto X Pure Edition</a> shortly after its release in 2015. The 2013 Moto X was a clean Android experience with Moto-branded apps which added gesture control and personalized Google Now AI, alongside excellent battery life, though Motorola's 2015 model wasn't as enticing as its predecessors. In the end, I bought a Really Blue Pixel phone with 32GB of storage.</p> <br>
			    	<a href="http://i.imgur.com/jRpG7TU.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="blog/img/lsu-magnolia.jpg" alt="LSU Magnolia" height="600px" width="400px" style="float:right;"></a>
			    	<p class="indent"><span class="bold">PROS:</span> I like to think of a smartphone as a successful mashup of the tech-enthusiast's early millenia lineup: the iPod, the camera, and the cell phone; combining all of the greatest gadgets. Generally I have about 10-15 albums pinned on Spotify and my pictures add up over time, given I do not usually take a lot of pictures. Though I've only had the phone for a month and a half, I've found myself snapping more photos than ever. Seriously, this camera is amazing, and Google allows free, unlimited cloud storage for photos taken with this phone! Also, music on this phone through headphones sounds really, really good coming from my previous phones, and is claimed to be an incredible boost from Google's previous Nexus releases. </p>
			    	<p class="indent">Besides pictures and music, however, I have a total of 86 apps currently installed, two being large games. Even with 15 apps constantly running, average 2.5/3.7GB of RAM used (68% utilization), the phone does not stutter during use, nor does the battery drain within a day. Again I've only owned the phone for a short time, but the battery tends to last me all day. Sometimes I forget to charge it in the evenings and it will still run until noon the following day! I am currently running Android Nougat 7.1.1 with the Pixel launcher, and quite honestly after running Nova launcher for five years I don't think I will touch another launcher on this phone. It is lightning fast despite not being able to tweak the icons and grid layout. Overall, Google Assistant is what takes the cake in my opinion, being that it's incredibly responsive and intuitive.</p>
			    	<p class="indent">Saving the best for last, the battery. First off, the official Facebook app cripples the battery <a href="http://i.imgur.com/o8EdCxX.jpg" target="_blank">as expected</a>. Once I charged my phone back up to full I uninstalled the Facebook app and ran off the mobile web page for the day. The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/PtzaVQJ.jpg" target="_blannk">results</a> show I gained about six additional hours of battery life, if not more. I charge my phone usually once I get home from work and haven't had to worry about recharging during the work day anymore. Even when playing games the battery lasts three times as long as my Moto X ever would. Just the other day I binged the new Fire Emblem game for four hours and still had 20% battery. This phone offers this phone offers the best battery optimization on an Android-powered device.</p><br>
			    	<p class="indent"><span class="bold">NEUTRAL:</span> The Pixel comes in two size variants, 32GB and 128GB. Coming from a phone with 64GB of storage and a MicroSD expansion of 64GB, I was worried about storage on my 32GB model (the Really Blue does not come in 128GB). Given that I can upload all of my photos to Google's cloud I have not ran into a space issue just yet, nevertheless I do see myself having to clear out my device's photos periodically like clearing Snapchat cache. I look at the space concern as a challenge to utilize cloud storage options, besides prioritizing what albums I have synced at a time.</p><br>
			    	<p class="indent"><span class="bold">CONS:</span> The phone's speakers are honestly not that great and are placed on the bottom of the phone, meaning my fingers are covering them up 9 times out of 10. When I'm not covering the speakers, they tend to have a metallic ring at high volumes. Second, the phone does not have a water-resistant coating like my previous Moto X's did. Though this has not posed a problem yet, I avoid taking my phone out in wet conditions.</p><br>
			    	<p class="indent">Overall the phone is the best Android phone on the market today. Since it is made by Google, Android is optimized to provide a snappy, battery-efficient experience. Despite not rocking front-facing speakers and the water-resistant coating, I would recommend this phone to anyone in the market for a new smartphone.</p>

						<p>Today is the due date for the final critique.</p><br>
						<p class="indent">I signed up for this class as an elective to learn the web design portion of front-end web production. Previously I had learned the basic of web development technologies and SEO implementation in another class, and was looking forward to learning web design. In the end I realized I had learned core design concepts while simultaneously obtaining the ability to implement advanced web development languages and tools.</p>
						<p class="indent">The class began as an intro to web development by running through the essentials of web development, including HTML5 and CSS3. Throughout the course we were assigned to build and design three websites as projects using the following topics: a restaurant, typography, and personal portfolio. </p>
						<p>For the <a href="https://github.com/josefaidt/art4567-restaurant" target="_blank">restaurant website</a> I chose to develop using HTML and CSS, designing a red and white themed website for my favorite fried chicken restaurant. The <a href="https://github.com/josefaidt/art4567-typography" target="_blank">typography site</a> was dedicated towards using transition effects and an icon font. This project I began using SCSS for styling in favor of the nesting and mixins opportunities it presents. Finally, the <a href="https://github.com/josefaidt/thejosef.life" target="_blank">personal portfolio</a>, which is now my website. Before, I used WordPress to build a simple web portfolio. This project I moved on to using Grunt as a task runner primarily for compiling my SCSS files and using Flexbox for the layout of elements.</p>
						<p class="indent">Overall my experiences with the web development technologies noted above contributed to my existing skill set, thus improving my outlook on websites' designs and how they assist in streamlining transactions. I plan to continue building onto this website to further add to my web production understandings.</p>
