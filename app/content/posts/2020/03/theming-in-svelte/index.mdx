Coming from React there are numerous theming solutions to choose from; styled-components, Emotion, styled-system, theme-ui &ndash; the list goes on. But in Svelte, a framework that feels like you have a front-row spot on The Platform&trade;, those kind of solutions don't exist. When I cracked open my brand new Svelte project I knew I wanted a theme toggle with persistence so visitors don't have to feel the pain of light mode if they don't want to.

Enter [svelte-themer](https://svelte-themer.now.sh). A theming solution I originally built it into my new Svelte website, but ultimately ended up splitting it off into its own package for others to use as well!

## What is Svelte?

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) has been labeled as the "new framework on the block", touted for being effective yet efficient for building web applications quickly. Compared to the big players in the game &mdash; React, Angular, and Vue &mdash; it certainly brings a unique approach to the build process though also component-based.

First of all, it feels very close to the platform. Check out this small snippet:

```html
<!-- src/components/Heading.svelte -->
<script>
  export let name = 'World'
</script>

<h1>Hello {name}</h1>

<style>
  h1 {
    color: green;
  }
</style>
```

That's it for a stateful heading component. There's a few things going on here:

```html
<!-- src/components/Heading.svelte -->
<script>
  // define a prop, `name`, (just like React)
  // give it a default value of `World`
  export let name = 'World'
</script>

<!-- use curly braces to refer to `name` value -->
<h1>Hello {name}</h1>

<style>
  /* scoped style */
  h1 {
    color: green;
  }
</style>
```

Now when we want to use it, it'll feel like using any other React component:

```html
<!-- src/App.svelte -->
<script>
  import Heading from './components/Heading.svelte'
</script>

<main>
  <Heading name="Hansel" />
</main>
```
