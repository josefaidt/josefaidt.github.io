**Note**: this is part two to the [previous blog post](https://josefaidt.dev/blog/2020/04/serverless-graphql-with-fauna-and-now) where we created an Apollo Server on top of Fauna, hosted on Vercel Now

## Overview

Last time we left on the note of security. Our existing endpoint is stood up and functional, but really anyone that knew of its existence could hit, and possibly abuse, our API. That's not ideal, so let's venture into what it takes to add third party authentication to our serverless endpoint.

- Completion of [Part 1](https://josefaidt.dev/blog/2020/04/serverless-graphql-with-fauna-and-now) OR existing Apollo endpoint on Vercel Now
- [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com)

## Auth0

> Rapidly integrate authentication and authorization for web, mobile, and legacy applications so you can focus on your core business.
