For a while now I've wanted to host a simple website that acted as a pretty front-end for my Plex server and the cluster of applications I use alongside Plex to enhance the experience. Applications like a request service (Ombi) and a metrics service (Tautulli). Originally I learned and built an NGINX-based container to use as the reverse proxy, though this was until I realized my new Linksys router reserved port 80 for _Linksys SmartConnect_. Ever since then I just kind of sat on the idea.

Over the course of a few days I scoured the web for references to ZEIT's Now platform looking for ways to use the Now Routing as a proxy. Their docs are great, but could this be done? Using the platform to proxy requests to these exposed applications running at my house? Short answer, yes.

## Pre-Requisites

- a running Plex server
- applications running on a few exposed ports
- a domain (myplexdomain.com)
- ZEIT Now account

That's about it. I won't go over how to set these apps up or forward ports on your router, but assuming you have this done already and simply want to create a website to proxy the requests then I hope this article serves you well.

## The Pain Point

Let's say we have the following application details:

| Application        | Port  | Location |
| ------------------ | ----- | -------- |
| Plex               | 32400 | home     |
| Request (Ombi)     | 9001  | home     |
| Metrics (Tautulli) | 9002  | home     |

With a home (external) IP of `50.50.500.192` (disclaimer: this IP is fake for demonstration purposes). We then set up our DNS via Google Domains with an A record for `@` pointing at our home IP.

Now if we navigate out to `myplexdomain.com:9001` we should see Ombi running. Same with Tautulli but with specifying port `9002`. Great, right? Everything works as intended. But what if we could give out this snazzy new domain without having our users specifying those ports? Users shouldn't have to remember or bookmark the address with the ports. Plus it's easier to remember something like `myplexdomain.com/request` than the port, right?

In comes ZEIT Now.

## Implementation

Now that we have all of these apps running, accessible from an external address, etc, let's go over setting up our frontend.

### Add Base Route to Applications

Before we get started, there is another pre-requisite to ensure application assets (like stylesheets) will be served over the proper prefix (ex: `request/`) rather than from the root. Edit Ombi and Tautulli to have the base routes of `request` and `metrics` respectively.

### Change NameServers to ZEIT Now

Next we'll need to add our new domain to ZEIT Now and point the nameservers to that of ZEIT. Something like this:

![Google Domains NameServers change example](./gdomains-dns-nameservers.png)

After a few hours or so the ZEIT Now domains panel should show that the domain is now verified. Great, we'll want to use the Now CLI to set up a new record.

Flip over to your terminal of choice and ensure you have the latest Now CLI installed with `yarn global add now@next`.

Remember our home IP? We'll need that to point the subdomain of `home` to that IP with `now dns add myplexdomain.com home A 50.50.500.192`. Once the change has propagated we should be able to access our applications by navigating to `home.myplexdomain.com:9001/request`. Fantastic.

### Our ZEIT Now Project

Ignoring the frontend for now, let's take a look at setting up the routing for our new Now project.

```shell
# create a new directory for the project
mkdir now-myplexdomain

# create the new Node project
cd now-myplexdomain
yarn init -y
touch now.json

# open with VSCode
code now-myplexdomain
```

It is important to note that we will specify an empty build command since we don't need to actually build anything for the Now deployment. Pop open your `package.json` file and copy the following:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "echo 'No build required, skipping...'"
  }
}
```

_Now_ we're ready to start the routing!

### ZEIT Now Routing

The [routing capabilities](https://zeit.co/docs/configuration/#project/routes) with ZEIT Now are ridiculously powerful, and the reason I went with this platform. With our fresh `now.json` file, let's make a few edits:

```json
{
  "public": false,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/request/(.*)",
      "dest": "http://home.myplexdomain.com:9001/request/$1"
    },
    { "src": "/metrics/(.*)", "dest": "http://home.myplexdomain.com:9002/metrics/$1" }
  ]
}
```

A few important things to note here.

- `"public": false` - this is needed for the Now deployment to show this project is [not public](https://zeit.co/docs/configuration/#project/public). I suppose we _could_ leave this open, however to tighten our security and the proxied requests, I leave this set to `false`.
- `"src": "/request/(.*)"` - little RegEx to pass _all_ subsequent requests to our destination
- `"dest": "http://home.myplexdomain.com:9001/request/$1"` - the `$1` is there to embed the capture group, passing the subsequent requests to appropriate target destination
- when hitting `/request` and not `/request/` the request will fail. To fix this we can add a redirect

#### Redirects

To fix the last item in the routing notes, let's set up a redirect:

```json
{
  "public": false,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/request/(.*)",
      "dest": "http://home.myplexdomain.com:9001/request/$1"
    },
    { "src": "/request", "status": 301, "headers": { "Location": "/request/" } },
    { "src": "/metrics/(.*)", "dest": "http://home.myplexdomain.com:9002/metrics/$1" },
    { "src": "/metric", "status": 301, "headers": { "Location": "/metrics/" } }
  ]
}
```

Now if we attempt to hit `/metrics` without the trailing slash, we should expect the behavior of redirecting the user to `/metrics/`. With these redirects we can also set up a sleek path to launch the Plex web application, which is external to our site.

```json
{
  "public": false,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/request/(.*)",
      "dest": "http://home.myplexdomain.com:9001/request/$1"
    },
    { "src": "/request", "status": 301, "headers": { "Location": "/request/login" } },
    { "src": "/metrics/(.*)", "dest": "http://home.myplexdomain.com:9002/metrics/$1" },
    { "src": "/metric", "status": 301, "headers": { "Location": "/metrics/" } },
    { "src": "/launch", "status": 301, "headers": { "Location": "https://app.plex.tv/" } }
  ]
}
```

With this update we can set up a `/launch` path in our frontend to easily send the user to Plex. You may also notice I added a `/login` to the request path, and this is because Ombi will not properly redirect. Instead we must force the user straight to the login page, which will then be redirected into the app's homepage if the auth token is present.

### Frontend

At this point, the frontend is trivial, though serving the content appropriately may not be. No worries, we'll take a quick look at a simple frontend implementation. Create a new file, `public/index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>myplexdomain</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/request">Request</a></li>
        <li><a href="/metrics">Metrics</a></li>
        <li><a href="/launch">Launch Plex</a></li>
      </ul>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

It's really quite bare, however for this proof-of-concept implementation I'll leave the styling up to your own creativity. But now we need a root route, so let's pop back over to our `now.json` file.

```json
{
  "public": false,
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/", "dest": "/public/index.html" },
    {
      "src": "/request/(.*)",
      "dest": "http://home.myplexdomain.com:9001/request/$1"
    },
    { "src": "/request", "status": 301, "headers": { "Location": "/request/login" } },
    { "src": "/metrics/(.*)", "dest": "http://home.myplexdomain.com:9002/metrics/$1" },
    { "src": "/metric", "status": 301, "headers": { "Location": "/metrics/" } },
    { "src": "/launch", "status": 301, "headers": { "Location": "https://app.plex.tv/" } }
  ]
}
```

That's it! If we run `now dev` we should see everything is functioning as intended.

### Deploy

The fun part, we've made it! Let's get this thing on the web.

```shell
# deploy to ZEIT Now, follow the prompts for naming
now

# once confirmed functional, deploy to production (to link the domain)
now --prod
```

Congratulations, you now have a functional frontend for your fancy Plex apps. Slap some CSS in there and go crazy.

## Final Thoughts

Learning ZEIT Now to this extent has been a rewarding journey. I've used the platform in the past, though this took my appreciation to a whole new level. I thought I wouldn't be able to have a frontend for apps running at my home due to my router issue, though I am incredibly glad I was able to accomplish this with ZEIT Now.
