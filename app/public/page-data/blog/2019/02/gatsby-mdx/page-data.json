Well, but it would be nice to write all of my pages in Markdown if only I could also use my JavaScript (React) components.</p>\n<p>That was when I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx\">MDX</a>.</p>\n<p>MDX is a blend of Markdown and JSX, the language prominently known for its use in React. I came across MDX on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS2784YfPpw\">Gatsby livestream</a> the other week and saw how they were using it to build their pages (with <a href=\"https://gatsby-plugin-mdx.netlify.com/\">gatbsy-mdx</a>). I thought that'd be great to use considering how tedious HTML can be to type even with the help of <a href=\"https://emmet.io/\">Emmet</a> and a few trusty VSCode extensions. Maybe not just typing, but reading, too.</p>\n<p>So I picked up and tried it out, and it is phenomenal to work with. The setup is much like setting up Markdown in Gatsby, and can use the same <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-remark-*</code> plugins. Though I haven't quite fully implemented it here on my site, I can't wait to convert and further modularize pages like my Résumé.</p>\n<p>If you're looking for a more customized version of Markdown, but don't want to overcomplicate things, try MDX. </p>",
