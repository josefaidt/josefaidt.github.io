This is my first official site built using <a href=\"https://gastbyjs.org\" target=\"_blank\">Gatsby.js</a>, and I had a great time using it. I've helped set up a site in the past, I'd played around with templates, and I contributed technical documentation to the project, but I never quite finished my website. Started quite a few times, actually, and ended up moving back over to another project. Thus is the hobby of development, I guess.</p>\n<p>Between my <a href=\"https://github.com/josefaidt/josefaidt.github.io/releases/tag/v1.2.1\" target=\"_blank\">old site</a> <em>(github)</em> and this iteration, I had set up a couple different prototypes; much of which included Express backends with React and React Router v4, however in the end I enjoyed the ease of use of using Gatsby and Netlify rather than managing a server. That wasn't the only speedbump, though. Gatsby offered me so much out of the box including offline support via service workers, GraphQL for querying page assets, and most importantly a <em>blazing</em> fast end product. If you're looking to rebuild your site soon, I can't recommend it enough.</p>\n<p>I hope to continue using this blog as a space for me to talk about whatever I'm working on, tech, code, music, etc. Perhaps I will continue sharing bits and pieces of my work with Gatsby as I add new features to the site, or even my thoughts on web development in general.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you'd like to learn more about the tech behind my site and hosting choice, stop by my <a href=\"https://github.com/josefaidt/josefaidt.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a> or by my <a href='https://trello.com/b/GQqL1K11/josefaidtme' target='_blank'>Trello board</a> to see what's in store.</p>",
