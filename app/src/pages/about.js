    <p>It all started in a quaint little town called Huntington, West Virgina...</p>
    <p>
      I grew up in a family of six, with three younger brothers. We all look similar, sporting the
      frequently-mispelled surname of Aidt

      . My family moved a few times while I was younger to a few different states &mdash; namely
      West Virgina, North Carolina, and Ohio &mdash; before moving to Louisiana as a final stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Louisiana that I spent most of my childhood and finished school, all the while
      participating in extra-carricular activies such as Boy Scouts

      I went on to play trumpet in LSU&#39;s marching band,{' '}

      . During my time at LSU I gained an adoration for web development and the technology behind
      the web, after all, I grew up online. Whether I was online learning or playing video games I
      always ended up browsing the web to find new and exciting websites fashioned with that next
      level of design flair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I never thought about getting into development.</i> My curriculum included classes that
      covered C++ and C#, SEO and the surrounding business, and even higher-level concepts regarding
      web usability and e-commerce. But it wasn&#39;t until I was in my final semester in college
      taking a communications-intensive art course that focused in web design. That&#39;s when I
      realized that I enjoyed building for the web. Not necessarily grinding out websites all the
      time, but actually building using web technologies.

      . There I was able to apply knowledge learned from my degree in addition to leaning on my
      brief programming background to help streamline existing processes and improve overall
      performance. It was great to learn while on the job, technically and intrapersonally. After
      leading deployment and discovery projects for our team, as well as assist in large-scale
      equipment deployments for the largest IT project in company history, I was presented with an
      opportunity to join the company&#39;s Business Information Services (BIS) team. There I was
      stationed to work for the ERP portion of the team utilizing my frontend web development
      skillset to engineer, modify, and maintain ERP submodules. Other than my web development
      assignments I developed ETL processes using SQL to ultimately create visual reports on
      scrubbed, reportable data by using SQL Server Reporting Services and{' '}

      Now we&#39;re to the present time. I&#39;ve continued to improve my IT and full-stack web

      Overall I hope to further my abilities as a full-stack JavaScript developer by striving for
      growth, both in the workplace and as an individual. If you&#39;d like to see what I&#39;m
