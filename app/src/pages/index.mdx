# Hello

My name is Josef, and I am a 26-year-old alumnus of Louisiana State University. I'm a
full-stack JavaScript developer currently employed as a Frontend UI Developer at <a href="https://twitter.com/IBM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@IBM</a>. When I'm not thinking about work or my personal projects I might be playing with my two
goofball dogs &mdash; Marvin and Maverick, hanging out with my friends enjoying our favorite
music tracks, or I might just be listening to deep house music playing video games. I'm a
sucker for movies with great soundtracks (i.e. written by John Williams) and Reese's
seasonals. Over the years I've taken interest in the wild world of the web and all it has to
offer. <br />
