Late 2018 I went to my first tech conference &ndash; Tableau Conference &ndash; in New Orleans. It was a massive conference full of workshops and sessions stretched across the New Orleans convention center, and the topics covered were mostly data related with a few gritty developer talks sprinkled throughout. I learned a ton of data concepts, tools, and people, but even though I attended the developer talks I didn't feel like I fit there. At the time in my position as a developer focusing 50%+ of my efforts on BI tasks, my attendance made sense. But after the conference I realized that I cared more about the JavaScript language and the way it was used to deliver Tableau reports rather than using Tableau or looking at data in that aspect.

Fast-forward to early 2019. I'm still relatively new at IBM and am now focusing solely on web development. I see on Twitter that [@jchiatt](https://twitter.com/jchiatt) was looking to plan a JavaScript conference in Jackson, Mississippi in a mere six weeks. *Six weeks*. On top of that it would end up as Mississippi's *first* conference of its kind! I had to go.

Through a lot of hard work and sheer willpower, JC managed to pull it together and deliver an amazing event. The agenda was so smooth albeit a few Tornado warnings and the talks were held in a single auditorium creating an intimate experience with a lineup full of incredible talks. Even the talks were ordered in such a way that felt like a novel. You could truly feel the amount of sincere thought that went into planning, curating, and executing.

I'll admit I was nervous to be going and talking to the people I draw from inspiration from on all things JavaScript. But it was all worth it. If you're thinking about attending MagnoliaJS 2020 I can't recommend it enough. Already I can't wait to see what's in store given such a successful first year.
