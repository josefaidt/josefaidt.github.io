<h2>A little about the author</h2><br>
Josef is a 25-year-old ISDS alumnus of Louisiana State University. He is an aspiring web designer & developer with a passion for the great outdoors. When he isn't thinking about work he might be playing with his two goofball dogs, Marvin and Maverick. He might be hanging out with his friends enjoying their favorite music tracks, or he might just be listening to deep house music playing video games. The author is a sucker for movies with great soundtracks (i.e. written by John Williams) and Reese's seasonals. Over the years he's taken interest in the wild world of the web and all it has to offer. Read more.
